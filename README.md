# Controls & Robotics Foundations

A collection of simulation-first control systems projects, focusing on mathematical modeling, PID tuning, and LQR implementation using Python and ROS2.

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. Mass-Spring-Damper Simulation (Week 1)
* **Goal:** Model 2nd-order system dynamics and analyze damping effects.
* **Tech:** Python, NumPy, Control Library.
* **Results:** Demonstrated the trade-off between Rise Time and Overshoot.
* **View Plot:** [Link to your plot in results folder]
